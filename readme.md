A tiny, secure, URL-friendly, unique string ID generator. Now available in pure Zig.

* **Small.** Less than 100 lines of code. No dependencies (zig std used just for an optional convenience function).
* **Fast.** It is 2 times faster than UUID.
* **Safe.** It can use any random generator you want.
* **Short IDs.** It uses a larger alphabet than UUID (`A-Za-z0-9_-`). So ID length was reduced from 36 to 21 symbols and it is URL friendly.
* **Portable.** Nano ID was ported to [20+ programming languages](https://github.com/ai/nanoid#other-programming-languages).

## Example

With default prng:
```zig
pub fn main() !void
{
    // Init rng and allocator
    var rng = std.rand.DefaultPrng.init(0);
    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
    defer _ = gpa.deinit();
    
    // Generate nanoid
    const result = try generate(gpa.allocator(), rng.random());
    defer gpa.allocator().free(result);
    
    // Print
    std.log.info("Nanoid: {s}", .{result});
}
```

With default csprng seeded properly:
```zig
const std = @import("std");
const nanoid = @import("nanoid");

pub fn main() !void
{   
    // Generate seed
    var seed: [std.rand.DefaultCsprng.secret_seed_length]u8 = undefined;
    std.crypto.random.bytes(&seed);

    // Initialize rng and allocator
    var rng = std.rand.DefaultCsprng.init(seed); 
    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
    defer _ = gpa.deinit();
    
    // Generate nanoid
    const result = try nanoid.generateDefault(gpa.allocator(), rng.random());
    defer gpa.allocator().free(result);

    // Print it at the end
    std.log.info("Nanoid: {s}", .{result});
}
```

## Comparison to UUID

Nano ID is quite comparable to UUID v4 (random-based).

It has a similar number of random bits in the ID (126 in Nano ID and 122 in UUID), so it has a similar collision probability.

It also uses a bigger alphabet, so a similar number of random bits are packed in just 21 symbols instead of 36.

For there to be a one in a billion chance of duplication, 103 trillion version 4 IDs must be generated.

## How to use

> The API exposes both low level unsafe procedures and higher level convenience wrappers with runtime checks.

### Generating an id

The simplest way to generate an id with the default alphabet and length is by using the function `generateDefault` like so:

```zig
const result = try nanoid.generateDefault(allocator, random);
defer allocator.free(result);
```

If you want to avoid the allocation, since we know the length of an id generated by `generateDefault`, you can use `generateDefaultToBuffer`.

```zig
var buffer: [nanoid.default_id_len]u8 = undefined;
const result = try nanoid.generateDefaultToBuffer(random, &buffer);
```

### Custom alphabets

To generate an id with the default length and a custom alphabet you can use `generateWithAlphabet` like so:

```zig
// This will generate that contains just numbers
const result = try nanoid.generateWithAlphabet(allocator, random, nanoid.alphabets.numbers);
```

If you want to avoid passing an allocator for the result, you can just allocate a buffer with at least `default_id_len` bytes and pass it to `generateDefaultToBuffer` or `generateWithAlphabetToBuffer`. 

The default alphabet includes the symbols "-_", numbers and English lowercase and uppercase letters.

You can find a variety of other useful alphabets inside of `nanoid.alphabets`.

### Regarding RNGs

You will need to provide an random number generator (rng) yourself. You can use the zig standard library ones, either `std.rand.DefaultPrng` or if you have stricter security requirements use `std.rand.DefaultCsprng`.

When you initialize them you need to provide a seed, providing the same one every time will result in the same ids being generated every time you run the program.

If you want a good secure seed you can generate one using `std.crypto.random.bytes`. Refer to the examples at the start of this readme for usage.

### Low level API

If you want a custom alphabet and length it is recommended that you create your own wrapper which does error checking and calls `generateUnsafe` or `generateWithIterativeRngUnsafe`.

`generateWithIterativeRngUnsafe` is the same as `generateUnsafe` except it will use `Random.int(u8)` instead of `Random.bytes()` to get a random byte at a time thus avoiding the need for a rng step buffer. Normally this will be slower but depending on your rng algorithm it might not be so the option is there in case you need but normally it is recommended you use `generateUnsafe` which requires a temporary buffer that will be filled using `Random.bytes` in order to improve performance.

In order to implement your own wrapper you can look at the implementation of `generateWithAlphabet` and `generateDefault`.

### Build steps

To add the library as a package to your zig project:
1. Download the repo and put it in a folder (eg: `thirdparty`) in your project.
2. Import the library `build.zig` like so: `const nanoid = @import("thirdparty/nanoid-zig/build.zig");`
3. Add the library as a package like so: `exe.addPackage(nanoid.getPackage("nanoid"));`

Full example:
```zig
const std = @import("std");
const nanoid = @import("thirdparty/nanoid-zig/build.zig");

pub fn build(b: *std.build.Builder) void 
{
    const target = b.standardTargetOptions(.{});
    const mode = b.standardReleaseOptions();

    const exe = b.addExecutable("zig-nanoid-test", "src/main.zig");
    exe.setTarget(target);
    exe.setBuildMode(mode);
    exe.addPackage(nanoid.getPackage("nanoid"));
    exe.install();
}
```
